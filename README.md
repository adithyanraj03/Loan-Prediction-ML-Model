# Loan-Prediction-ML-Model
Machine Learning Model to Train and Prediction Loan of Costumers from Given Data .

Using lazypredict to Test other optimal model for the Specific datas. 

This machine learning model predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various features such as applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, etc. It uses a supervised learning algorithm to classify loan applications as either approved or rejected.

## Features

The Loan Prediction ML Model offers the following features:

- Training the model using historical loan application data
- Predicting loan approval status for new loan applications
- Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics
- Easy integration with other applications or systems

## Installation

To install and use the Loan Prediction ML Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan-Prediction-ML-Model.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the model training script: `python train_model.py`
4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions by running the prediction script: `python predict.py`

## Usage

To use the Loan Prediction ML Model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a CSV file containing loan application data. The file should have the same format as the training data.
2. Run the prediction script with the path to the CSV file as an argument: `python predict.py loan_data.csv`
3. The script will output the loan approval status for each application in the CSV file.

## Model Evaluation

The Loan Prediction ML Model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. To evaluate the model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a separate test dataset with known loan approval status.
2. Run the evaluation script: `python evaluate_model.py test_data.csv`
3. The script will output the evaluation metrics for the model.
